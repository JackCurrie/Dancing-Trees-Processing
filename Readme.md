# Dancing Recursive Trees 
 
    Inspired by reading "Chaos: Making a New Science", listening to the music 
    of Kendrick Lamar, and seeing a cool visualization of a recursive tree moving
    to mouse stimulus, I want to make a recursive tree that moves smoothly 
    to audio stimulus


## Where this is Going

    * Smooth movements for the trees based on audio inputs
    * Addition of multiple trees 
    * Possibly a tree class with a constructor which allows its size and location
      and possibly color to be determined form the start

## Credit where it is Due
   
  Based on the sketch "Recursive Tree" by Daniel Shiffman (shiffman.net).
  Your work is awesome.

  Uses the "Minim" library for audio input (https://github.com/ddf/Minim) made by
  Anderson Mills and Damien Difede.


### Things to know before running sketch on _your_ machine

   This project makes use of the "minim" library, make sure it is installed in your
   processing environment.


   This probably goes without saying, but this code can only be ran in the
   "Processing Development Environment," found at the following URL https://processing.org/
