# Dancing Recursive Trees 
 
   Inspired by reading "Chaos: Making a New Science", listening to the music 
    of Kendrick Lamar, and seeing a cool visualization of a recursive tree moving
    to mouse stimulus, I want to make a recursive tree that moves smoothly 
    to audio stimulus




## Where this is Going

    * Smooth movements for the trees based on audio inputs
    * Addition of multiple trees 
    * Possibly a tree class with a constructor which allows its size and location
      and possibly color to be determined form the start

## Credit where it is Due
   
  Based on the sketch "Recursive Tree" by Daniel Shiffman (shiffman.net)
  Your work is awesome.
